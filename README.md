Phenotypic and genetic analysis code (Mplus)

This repository contains the Mplus output files for the main phenotypic and genetic models included in this project.

Mplus output files are structured where the input is presented first, then the unstandardized and standardized results are presented. 

This repository contains the following: 
- The full EFs and g phenotypic model and the relevant model comparisons
- The full EFs and g genetic model
- The full EFs genetic model without g and relevant model comparisons 
- The models constraining the A, C, and E variance components for the Common EF factors to be equal

For the model comparisons where we constrained the A, C, and E variance components to be equal, we had to drop the residual C components that were estimated at 0 to aid model convergence.
The full genetic model of EFs without the residual 0 C estimates is also included in this repository. 

As each model comparison has an output file, only the output files corresponding to the results section are included here. 
Additional output files, like task-level ACE comparisons or the phenotypic model without g, are available upon request.
